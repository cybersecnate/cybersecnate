Hi my name is Nathan Santos a.k.a Nate. I'm a cybersecurity professional focused on SOC environments, using SIEMs (IBM QRadar, Splunk, Sentinel), XDR/EDR (Trend Micro, Defender), WAF, and Cloudflare CDN. Experience in Threat Hunting, log analysis, and phishing handling, with expertise in creating Playbooks and Runbooks for standardizing incident responses.

My approach combines a Blue Team perspective and Red Team fundamentals, allowing for an offensive approach to defenses and reducing response time. My purpose is to unite engineering, automation, and strategy to raise the security maturity of organizations and promote more resilient, intelligent, and efficient operations.

Currently learning about cloud security and DevSecOps.
